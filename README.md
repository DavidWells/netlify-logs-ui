## User Stories

### Linkable Log lines

As a Netlify user, I'd like to be able to share direct links to log lines to assist in debugging my builds.

### Multi line log links

As a Netlify user, I'd like to able to link to entire blocks of the build log to aid in faster debugging, sharing with support, and asking colleagues questions about different parts of our build process
